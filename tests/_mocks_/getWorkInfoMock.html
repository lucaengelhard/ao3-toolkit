                      A complete rewrite of Book Seven with a darker and more
                      dangerous outlook on war.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Mostly Hermione-centric. Mostly follows canon but provides
                      a different look at how the relationships in HP could have
                      formed had Hermione realized that she and Ron did not fit
                      well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really
                      what she was looking for the whole time. The story of what
                      could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the
                      Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves.

                    <p>
                      Features added subplots, alt POVs, OC characters, and a
                      gritty and realistic view of the war. HHR is the main
                      pairing, but this fic is about more than just their
                      relationship. It is a fully developed story about the war
                      following Hermione and her allies through the fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘So why are you still here?’ Harry asked Ron.<br />‘Search
                      me,’ said Ron.<br />‘Go home then,’ said Harry.<br />‘Yeah,
                      maybe I will!’ shouted Ron, and he took several steps
                      towards Harry, who did not back away.

                      This fic involves mature content, explicit language, dark
                      themes, dark magic, difficult topics, violence, torture,
                      blood, descriptions of injuries and the long-term
                      consequences, mercy killings, heroic sacrificial
                      tendencies, LGBTQ and coming out anxiety, major character
                      deaths, and all the other difficult things that come with
                      a story about war. Everyone has different tolerances, so
                      while I like to think that the darker aspects of this
                      story are not gratuitous or overdone—and that this story
                      has plenty of happy, cathartic, and humourous moments—I do
                      not want to accidentally trigger anyone without sufficient
                      warning.

                    <p>
                      So please consider this as your warning. This fic has a
                      level of gritty war brutality that some may not be
                      comfortable with. I've done my best to include chapter
                      specific warnings and summaries for chapters containing
                      the more difficult content, but I've yet to complete this
                      task, so just be mindful of that as you read. Please note
                      this fic does not involve bashing, instead it takes a
                      realistic look at the war, the consequences of actions,
                      the price of power, and grey morality of people faced with
                      difficult situations.

                      Hermione tensed as the scene started to unfold in front of
                      her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What was happening? For being ‘<em
                        >the brightest witch of her age</em
                      >’, it was as if her brain suddenly short-circuited and
                      stopped functioning. After <u>everything</u> they had been
                      through, the fights they had endured previously – Ron and
                      Harry’s pissing fit in fourth year – she could feel the
                      tension. She could visibly see the flames enlarging
                      towards an inevitable explosion. The building pressure was
                      familiar, like their fights before – but she knew, this
                      time, it was different.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      They were arguing about whether or not Harry cared about
                      Ginny and the rest of the Weasleys. Or was it that Ron was
                      upset that the mission thus far had been long? Exhausting?
                      Difficult? Utterly defeating? It was ludicrous. They were
                      arguing about everything and nothing at the same time –
                      but none of it was tangible.

                      Hermione tried to step in to calm things down, to bring
                      Ron to the rational conclusion that Harry didn’t mean what
                      Ron seemed to think he did. But Ron seemed determined to
                      mimic the ever-growing storm outside as his face grew
                      redder with rage. Ron exploded again – lashing out at her
                      too this time, her and the fact that her’
                      <em>parents were safely out of the way’</em>. As if the
                      fact that she had confunded and obliviated her parents
                      that past summer made things easier on her or made the
                      ongoing situation less intense. As if he thought that it
                      somehow excused her from feeling the same worry and
                      anguish that he was clearly feeling, because she now had
                      less to lose in the war. Her chest tightened, and her jaw
                      clenched as she felt the prickle of tears at the corner of
                      her eyes. She didn’t know how to respond. But it didn’t
                      matter because Harry was already screaming back, raising
                      the octave of the tent another level only for Ron to
                      immediately yell once more in retort.

                        feed you up and–‘

                        had raised her own.

                        other, all of them were forced backwards a few steps by
                        the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from
                        either side of the transparent barrier as though they
                        were seeing each other clearly for the first time.

                      It was suddenly quiet, despite the noisy raindrops which
                      hit the tent heavily. It felt as though the tent had
                      frozen; time stood still. Hermione could taste the acid in
                      the air, see the hatred in Ron’s eyes and the raging anger
                      in Harry’s. The familiar building tension had finally
                      snapped, but it snapped in an unfamiliar way as Hermione
                      had dreaded. Lingering under the raw and turbulent
                      emotions was something new, something different –
                      something broken. Like a thousand shards of glass on the
                      floor, this felt irreparable.

                      She heard Harry speak, but this time his voice was calm,
                      cold, and flat.

                      Hermione’s eyes opened a fraction wider, and it was at
                      that moment she realized that silent tears had been
                      streaming down her cheeks. She was crying, crying because
                      subconsciously, she knew what they had just lost even if
                      her mind was still racing and trying to figure out what to
                      say – how to repair the situation. Crying because she knew
                      what Ron was about to ask her, and she already knew her
                      response. Then Ron spoke, and she dreaded the words.

                      She stared at him, her eyes wide as tears rolled down her
                      face, and the words slipped through her lips quietly. She
                      didn’t want to do this.

                    <p>
                      Ron’s face twisted in frustration. He knew that Hermione
                      <em>knew</em> what he meant. Angrily he clarified for her,
                      a hint of desperation in his eyes.

                      Hermione looked anguished. A loud roll of thunder outside
                      of the tent sent a shiver down her spine. It felt like she
                      was burning from the inside out. Her stomach was twisting,
                      the feeling of sickness at the back of her throat. She
                      took a breath, blinking her eyes once before she responded
                      in the calmest voice she could manage.

                    <p>
                      Ron didn’t wait, though. He didn’t wait for her to explain
                      her reasons. He didn’t want to hear them. He didn’t want
                      her to remind him that the two of them, <em>together</em>,
                      had promised to follow Harry and support him on his
                      mission to hunt and destroy Horcruxes. The mission that
                      Albus Dumbledore had assigned them. All of them. The
                      mission that literally the entire wizarding world was
                      depending on them completing – even though no one knew
                      about it. He never listened. He never thought.

                      Why did she ever believe that this would be different?

                      His face was ugly. Angry. Filled with a betrayal that was
                      unjustified and selfish. She saw the turn of his shoulders
                      as he started to pull away, as he started toward the door
                      of the tent. She tensed and raised a hand as if to grab
                      and stop him.
                    </p>
                    <p><em> They had to fix this! </em></p>
                    <p>
                      A wave of nausea and desperation flew over her, but she
                      was impeded by her own shield charm. Waving her wand to
                      remove it, she hurried after him through the tent door and
                      into the rainstorm leaving Harry standing motionless
                      inside. She screamed his name, calling him to come back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <em> ‘Ron, no – please – come back, come back!’ </em>

                    <p>
                      Running farther from the tent, she caught the faintest
                      sound of an apparition <em>pop </em>and her hand, which
                      had still been slightly outstretched, fell to her side.
                      She stopped. Her knees quivered as her lip trembled and
                      the rain soaked through her hair.
                    </p>
                    <p>This <em>was</em> different.</p>
                    <p>
                      Turning solemnly on her heel, she walked slowly back to
                      the tent, her eyes clouded and stuck to the ground.
                      Stepping in under the flap, she saw that Harry had not
                      moved an inch. He stared at her, his expression a strange
                      mix that she did not have the capacity to process. Every
                      bone in her body felt like lead. Her hair was plastered to
                      her face. The wind howled and pulled aggressively outside
                      as she stared back at Harry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      She felt like she was screaming her words, but she knew
                      her voice was soft. Weak. Worn. Her face scrunched as the
                      dam holding her emotions back broke, and heaving sobs
                      wracked through her chest. She crumbled into the armchair
                      in the corner of the tent as she let what felt like
                      decades of stress, anguish, pain, and loss flow through
                      her – not caring when she felt Harry hesitate near her and
                      then the presence of a soft blanket being placed gently on
                      her shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She heard him leave. She knew he was headed to his own
                      bunk. She knew that she should get herself together, get
                      organized, adjust their plan, figure out their next move –
                      do anything other than sitting as the pathetic curled-up
                      ball that she currently was. But she didn’t care. Right
                      now, it felt like a piece of her had died.

                      Hermione woke painfully the next morning. Her hair had
                      dried terribly, caked on her face with a few small leaves
                      that had gotten tangled up in the storm. Her chest hurt
                      like she’d run a mile, her eyes were undoubtedly pink and
                      swollen, and her body screamed at her for having sat
                      curled up in a chair all night. Dried tear tracks and snot
                      covered her face, arms and the blanket that Harry had
                      placed on her the night before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Normally she would be embarrassed by her current state.
                      Not because she cared about appearances – no, Hermione
                      Granger did not care about that – but because she,
                      Hermione Granger, <em>always </em>kept a cool head. She
                      <em>never</em> broke down like she did last night. She
                      <em>never</em> succumbed to the dread that secretly filled
                      her heart. She <em>never</em> gave in or gave up – but
                      last night she had, and it was one of her lowest moments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Stiffly she shifted into a fully upright position and
                      blinked around the room. It was quiet, and the tent was
                      lit with bright sunlight with the faint sound of birds
                      chirping in the background. It gave no hint to the
                      disturbance that had unfolded in this very space the
                      evening before. She glanced toward Harry’s bunk and saw
                      that his back was to her, and his shoulders moved slowly
                      with each deep breath he took – still asleep and almost
                      peaceful looking to anyone who didn’t know him. Hermione
                      knew him, though, and the slight tension in his shoulders
                      and the blanket twisted around his ankles gave way to the
                      truth that he had slept terribly, probably as bad as she
                      did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Stifling a groan, she pulled herself from the chair,
                      staying as quiet as possible and set the blanket back
                      down. She did not want to wake Harry. He needed his rest
                      more than he would ever let on, but in truth, she also did
                      not have the heart or the courage she needed to face him
                      just yet. Last night it had felt like a piece of her heart
                      had died, and she knew that Harry would be nursing his own
                      wounds in his own way and that she needed to be there for
                      him. But right now, she looked down at her dirty and still
                      damp clothes feeling a bit disgusted with herself; she
                      needed a shower. And tea. And just a minute or two alone.
                      Frowning at the blanket before her, still covered in her
                      dried snot and tears, she pulled her wand from her sweater
                      pocket and muttered a quick cleaning charm. Then, quiet as
                      a church mouse, she crept toward Harry’s bunk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Staring down at him, she could see that his brow was
                      furrowed, and as she suspected, the Horcrux locket was
                      draped loosely over his neck. It rested on the mattress
                      next to his chest. Gently, she reached down and undid the
                      clasp, pulling the locket away from him. Almost instantly,
                      the crease in his brow lessened, and he breathed deeper.
                      With a small but sad smile on her face, Hermione snuck to
                      the tent bathroom, grabbed fresh clothes on the way,
                      closed the door and placed the locket around her neck.
                      Taking a deep breath, she stripped off her dirty clothes.
                      Then she turned on the water with her wand, adding a
                      heating spell until steam started to rise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The shower in the tent was actually very cleverly
                      designed. The nozzle at the top was enchanted so that
                      tapping it with your wand activated an
                      <em>aqua eructo</em> charm until the nozzle was tapped
                      again to turn off. The bathroom was fairly small, so it
                      did not take long until steam filled the entire room. Then
                      she stepped into the small shower stall and closed the
                      curtain behind her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She showered longer than what she would ever typically
                      allow herself. Usually, her bathing, all of their bathing
                      actually, was utilitarian – to the point and effective.
                      Though that was probably due to her influence of wanting
                      them to be efficient and the general desire that they all
                      had for not wanting to get caught by snatchers with one of
                      them stark naked in the shower while they needed to escape
                      and apparate quickly. Today though, she allowed herself
                      time to scrub every inch of her body, which she knew was
                      her attempt to scrub away the remorse, sadness, and
                      overall feelings of disappointment from the night before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The locket swung loosely on her chest as she bathed. It
                      was a nuisance, and she could have left it with Harry, but
                      Hermione had always known that she handled the Horcruxes
                      better than the two boys combined. Harry needed to rest,
                      and sleeping an entire night with the locket on would only
                      make the day ahead of them more difficult than it was
                      already going to be. Besides, she smirked grimly to
                      herself; the locket was dirty with dark magic – it could
                      use a bath.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She cringed inwardly at that, then pondered if the reason
                      why the locket did not impact her so strongly could be
                      related to the meditation skills her parents had taught
                      her as a child. The same meditation techniques that she
                      had religiously continued to use since she was first
                      taught them at eight years old. She’d never mentioned it
                      to anyone, not even to the boys, but as a child, she used
                      to struggle with anxiety related to her insatiable desire
                      to be the best in everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘<em>Classic perfectionist</em>’, they’d said.</p>
                    <p>
                      Being ‘<em>brilliant</em>’ had come with its tolls, and
                      wanting to always be the best in school had left her
                      anxious as a child. So as a young kid, her parents had
                      taught her how to meditate. They taught her how to
                      breathe, relax, organize her thoughts, and work through
                      problems logically and calmly. Ironically, this skill had
                      helped her in almost every single facet of her life thus
                      far and very well might be the best skill she had – and
                      yet not one person knew she had that skill. At least not
                      for her mentioning it. She suspected several of her
                      professors were aware it, and it was very likely the only
                      reason why she, Harry, and Ron were still alive now. If
                      she ever saw her parents again, if they ever remembered
                      her again, she would thank them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With that thought, Hermione ran her fingers through her
                      wet curly hair one last time and rested her palms and
                      forehead against the cool wall of the shower stall. She
                      allowed herself two minutes of deep calm breathing as the
                      hot water pounded between her shoulder blades, loosening
                      her stiff muscles while the locket hung lightly from her
                      neck – then she opened her eyes. Pulling back the curtain,
                      she stepped out of the shower stall, grabbed her wand from
                      the sink counter and then tapped the overhead nozzle to
                      shut off the water. Casting a quick drying spell, she then
                      grabbed her fresh clothes but paused when she caught her
                      reflection in the mirror. She looked tired. Freshly
                      scrubbed with tinges of pink in her cheeks from the heat,
                      hair still damp and hanging in curls around her shoulder –
                      but the tired she saw seemed to be emanating from her
                      bones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Her face was skinnier, not gaunt, but thinner. The whole
                      of her was. Being on the run was not luxurious – as Ron
                      had clearly recently concluded – and she frowned at her
                      reflection. If they were truly to fight and win this war,
                      they needed to spend at least a little more time trying to
                      eat well-balanced meals. She would need to look through
                      their supplies today and their schedule to allow more time
                      for food collection and management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Pulling on her clothes, an old washed-out pair of muggle
                      jeans that showed wear marks at the knees and a
                      long-sleeve, thin and loose-fitting charcoal v-neck
                      sweater, she sighed before brushing her teeth and then
                      turned to her hair. It was the usual bushy mess that she
                      had come to accept. She arched an eyebrow cautiously at it
                      – as if trying not to spook or upset it and thus make it
                      worse. She cast an additional drying spell to remove the
                      lingering dampness. Then she opted to pull it into a messy
                      pony on the top of her head. It flopped lamely to the side
                      – her hair was simply too heavy and thick to look cute in
                      a high pony. So, she twisted it into a large knot and left
                      it there piled atop her head.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Leaning back against the sink, she slowly pulled on her
                      socks. They were purple, knitted, oversized, and warm –
                      perfect since the weather was getting cooler with each
                      passing day. Standing straight with determination, she
                      grabbed her wand and turned to face the mirror once more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <em>
                        Well, this is as good as it is going to get today,
                      </em>
                      she thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Leaving the small bathroom, she heard a gentle
                      <em>clicking </em>noise in the kitchen area and turned to
                      the left, walking down the very small and very short
                      hallway that led back to the common area of the tent. She
                      paused at the end, looking at Harry, who had two chipped
                      tea mugs sitting on the kitchen table with some small
                      scones on a plate in the middle –
                      <em>they were the last of the scones that they had</em>,
                      she cataloged mentally as a reminder that they would need
                      to grab some more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He had heard her approaching and looked up about a moment
                      after she had stopped moving. The air felt tense with
                      lingering unsaid words and unsure feelings. Her left hand
                      fiddled nervously with the bottom hem of her shirt. She
                      did not remember ever feeling awkward with Harry in the
                      past, but she didn’t know what to say – neither of them
                      did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Harry, bless his heart though, spoke first and spoke
                      softly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hey,” he said, his hand nervously fidgeting with the spoon
                      he’d likely been using to stir the tea. He was looking
                      directly at her. His eyes were worn and unsure, and she
                      could see the stress he carried in his shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Hey,” she said softly as her left hand fell from the hem
                      of her shirt to clasp her wand in front of her. She saw
                      him relax a fraction, the worry in his eyes becoming
                      slightly more hopeful. She could not imagine what he must
                      be thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I made tea,” he said somewhat abruptly. But his voice was
                      still gentle, like she was a small injured animal that he
                      was worried he might frighten away if he moved too quickly
                      or spoke too loud. “It got cold, though. S-So I just used
                      a warming charm – to reheat it. It’s one milk and two
                      sugars. I’m sorry – I hope it’s okay?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The last part came out in a bit of a jumble, and Hermione
                      could see the hopeful yet desperate look in his eyes. His
                      genuine concern that his gone-cold-then-reheated-tea might
                      not be ‘okay’ was adorable, and his attempt at ensuring
                      <em>they</em> were okay was clear. Harry was hopelessly
                      helpful and caring – and he had remembered how she took
                      her tea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione smiled, it was tired but genuine, and her
                      appreciation for his efforts shone through. It was
                      ridiculous for them to feel this uneasy around each other.
                      They’d never had this problem before, and they had been
                      through a lot together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It’s perfect, Harry, thank you,” she said as she walked
                      toward the table to take a seat opposite to the side that
                      he was standing on and set her wand down beside her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He grinned in relief and slowly lowered himself down to
                      the table, patiently waiting while she took a sip of her
                      tea first before grabbing his own gently to hold it near
                      his mouth. Holding hers in a similar fashion, both hands
                      on the warm mug, elbows propped on the table, and the mug
                      hovering just below her chin, she could see the way he
                      studied her face – trying to figure out what to say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It’s okay, Harry,” she said softly, removing one hand and
                      reaching it out gently toward his.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He dropped a hand from his mug and allowed her to grasp
                      his fingers before she placed their intertwined hands
                      between them in the center of the table. She gave him a
                      firm squeeze, but his eyes still searched her face,
                      desperate for something.
                    </p>
                    <p>“<em>We -</em> are okay,” she said with surety.</p>
                    <p>
                      Harry let out a breath he had been holding, his head
                      dropped slightly, shoulders sagging, and he put his tea
                      mug down to place his free hand over his face. He sat for
                      a moment, head held in his hand before he quickly propped
                      himself back up with a deep breath, running his hand
                      through his wild black locks. He looked briefly up at the
                      ceiling before his eyes fell back to her face. They were
                      slightly red now, and she could almost feel the prickle of
                      his tears that had formed in the corner of his eyes. She
                      felt her own sting as she stared intently back at him,
                      both of them trying to push their eotions back down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Thank god,” he said weakly, with a look of sad relief
                      flooding his face. “I’m so sorry, Hermione.”
                    </p>
                    <p>His eyes were genuine, and he gripped her hand back.</p>
                    <p>
                      “I know,” she said with earnest. She set her cup down as
                      well, and they instinctively grabbed each other’s hands –
                      now sitting across from each one another tightly gripping
                      the other as if they might lose one another if they let
                      go. “I – I know. I am too. I am so, so sorry, Harry.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “You shouldn’t be,” he said weakly. “You have nothing to
                      be sorry for. You stayed.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He stared at her with an adoration she wasn’t sure she’d
                      seen before.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Thank you for staying,” he said quietly.</p>
                    <p>
                      “Of course,” she replied, her eyes flicking across his
                      face. “Of course I would stay, Harry. I said that I would.
                      I told you I would be here until the end – always.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Harry smiled at her again. With some of the tension having
                      now left his body, he rolled his shoulders back to a more
                      comfortable position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I know,” he said quietly. “But still. I know it hasn’t
                      been easy – and I’m sorry that I don’t seem to know what
                      I’m doing half the time. It’s because I don’t. I wish I
                      did. But I don’t. And I’m sorry for that,” he rambled
                      before pausing. He looked at her carefully, sincerely, and
                      spoke the next words slowly and with meaning. “I want you
                      to know how much I need you here. How much I rely on you.
                      And how grateful I am that you stayed. I know that last
                      night wasn’t easy for you – but I’m so, so thankful that
                      you stayed.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione stared at him; their hands had risen slightly
                      between the two of them, with Harry clutching them almost
                      desperately at his chest. One single tear fell from the
                      corner of her eye, and she smiled with great sadness, her
                      heart feeling heavy, but feeling confident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “You’re right,” she said softly. “It was hard. But doing
                      the right thing often is – it’s not about making the easy
                      choices or doing what we want to do. It’s about doing the
                      right thing and doing what we need to do. I don’t regret
                      staying. The decision was easy, so don’t you dare ever
                      think anything different–”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Harry had opened his mouth, perhaps to protest, perhaps to
                      thank her again, perhaps to say she shouldn’t be so
                      absolute in her stance – she didn’t know what he was going
                      to say, but she didn’t care. She cut him off and
                      continued. She wanted to get all of this out and on the
                      table now because she didn’t want to keep skirting around
                      on eggshells in a small tent while they had Horcruxes to
                      find and destroy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “The decision was easy,” she said more firmly, fixing him
                      with a solid stare. “Seeing Ron leave. That – that was
                      hard. It was hard because it hurt. I’m sad, Harry. I’m
                      sad. I’m disappointed. I’m upset. I’m flabbergasted that
                      he even thought to ask me to go with him! I expected more
                      – I expected him to stay true to his word and to see this
                      through. I expected him to be reliable and – and I
                      expected him to, for once, see the bigger picture and
                      understand that this – all of <em>this </em>– what we are
                      doing here – is so much bigger than any of us as
                      individuals. That we have to continue, that we have to do
                      whatever we must to complete this mission.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione fixed Harry with a stern look of resolve before
                      she continued. Harry himself was quiet now, sitting in a
                      slight lean toward her, and she could see a small glint of
                      determination reforming in his eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I am upset about Ron, Harry,” she said to make herself
                      perfectly clear before taking a breath and squeezing his
                      hands once firmly. “But I will get over it. Hard times
                      show us who we really are – they show you someone’s true
                      character. I always knew Ron was a little bit unreliable
                      and a bit lazy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She gave Harry a small smile, and he smiled gently too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I guess.” She paused. “I guess I just thought that when
                      things got really bad, that when it really came down to
                      it, that I would be able to count on him. I guess I just
                      hoped – that he was a little different.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Harry’s smile was grim when he spoke.</p>
                    <p>“I know,” he said, his voice rough. “So did I.”</p>
                    <p>
                      They sat in silence for a moment, each staring at the
                      hands still interlaced between them. Harry absently rubbed
                      his right thumb over her knuckles in a soothing motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “He may still come back,” Harry said with a small smile
                      and a tiny glint of optimism. She could feel his gaze land
                      upon her, waiting for her to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione’s brow creased as she mulled this over. It was a
                      possibility, but she found that her eyes were entranced by
                      the small circles that Harry’s thumb was still making over
                      her knuckles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Maybe,” she said slowly and raised her eyes to look at
                      Harry again. “Maybe. But – that won’t change how I feel.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Harry quirked an eyebrow at her as if he was looking for
                      her to confirm what she meant by this statement, and in
                      return, she gave him her most direct stare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It won’t change how I feel now,” she stated firmly. “What
                      happened here – if he comes back. Maybe – maybe I can
                      forgive him. Maybe we can be friends. But – I can’t look
                      past this. I – I won’t go back to how I felt before.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Harry looked at her carefully, a thought present in the
                      sight furrow of his brows, and he nodded slowly to show
                      his understanding. Harry was aware of the feelings that
                      Hermione had started to develop toward Ron – not just
                      because he was a keen and observant person, but also
                      because the two of them had briefly touched upon it in
                      conversation. Hermione had been jealous when Ron had
                      started snogging Lavender Brown in sixth year, and Harry
                      had helped her deal with it, telling Hermione that Ron
                      truly was interested in her but was an idiot and didn’t
                      recognize his own feelings. It may have been harsh and
                      earned him a small half-hearted smack from Hermione at the
                      time – but it was true, and Harry knew it. Ron, for all
                      his worth, was not always the brightest. It was very
                      likely that he only ‘liked’ Hermione because they spent so
                      much time together. When in reality, they had absolutely
                      nothing in common and argued often. Harry had always been
                      the bridge between the two of them; he had always been the
                      buffer. Given some space, Ron would probably take interest
                      in other girls and forget his feelings for Hermione all
                      together. But he had never said that to her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione nodded in return, and Harry squeezed her hands
                      once more before dropping them both back on the table and
                      putting on his best smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “So how about breakfast,” he said with slightly
                      over-exaggerated cheer. “I was up all night baking these
                      things.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hermione laughed, always thankful for Harry’s ability to
                      move on and force one foot in front of the other. She
                      reached for a scone, taking a bite and complimented him on
                      his cooking skills before taking another sip of the
                      gone-cold-then-reheated-tea-that’s-gone-cold-again tea
                      that Harry had made her.
